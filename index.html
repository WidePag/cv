        <p>I am the widest pag of them all. My research focuses on dicovering different ways to increase my width using new breakthroughs in emote creation. My work has been supported by the Pepes, the monkas, the JAMS, and the Chads, and I have won
          the
          7tv award for best emote in 2021. My work also branches off into less wide forms of PagMan, and variations of it, such as SadPag, PagManCD, Paggi, and the wide variants of those emotes.</p>
